# 🚨 AI Service Quota Issue - Fix Guide

## ❌ Problem
Your Google Gemini API key has exceeded the free tier quota limits.

## ✅ Solutions

### Option 1: Upgrade to Paid Plan (Recommended)
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click on "Upgrade" or "Billing"
4. Choose a paid plan that fits your needs
5. Your existing API key will work with the upgraded plan

### Option 2: Create New API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new project or use existing one
3. Generate a new API key
4. Replace the `API_KEY` in your `.env` file:
   ```
   API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
   ```

### Option 3: Wait for Quota Reset
- Free tier quotas reset daily
- Check [Google AI Studio Quotas](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits) for exact reset times

## 🧪 Test After Fix
Once you've upgraded or got a new API key:

```bash
# Restart the server
npm start

# Test the health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/chat/health

# Should return: {"status":"healthy",...}
```

## 💡 Current Status
- ✅ Server is running on port 3000
- ✅ Web interface is accessible at http://localhost:3000
- ❌ AI service unavailable due to quota limits
- ✅ Fallback responses are working (basic travel advice)
